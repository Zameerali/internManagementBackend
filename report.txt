 What I Learned:

1. Database Design with Foreign Keys
Created a normalized relational database with tables like interns, tasks, profiles, projects, and a junction table intern_projects.

Learned how to use foreign key constraints to establish relationships between tables.

2. Manual SQL Queries in Node.js
Used the mysql2/promise library to write and execute raw SQL queries.

Understood how to structure parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and make the code secure and flexible.

3. Modular Architecture
Separated application logic into models, controllers, and routes.

Models handle database logic, controllers process requests and responses, and routes map HTTP methods to controller functions.

4. Working Without an ORM
Gained practical experience in handling raw SQL without the abstraction of ORMs like Sequelize.

5. REST API Design
Built clean, RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

Designed endpoints to return meaningful status codes and messages.

Tested all endpoints

6. Debugging & Error Handling

Implemented basic error handling to return 4xx/5xx responses as needed.
